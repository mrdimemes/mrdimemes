ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Dmitry! I am a student and (beginner) developer from Russia.  
I am interested in machine learning but am currently studying web development.  
My goal is to become an excellent front-end developer as quickly as possible, after which I want to master the backend and become a full-stack developer.  

My current skills is: Python 3.7+ (core, numpy, matplotlib); HTML 5; CSS 3 (core, Sass); JavaScript (core).  
I'm currently learning ReactJS.

English is not my first language, so please let me know if I make a mistake. I will really appreciate it.

You can email me anytime or wind me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrdimemes)
